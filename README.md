# Social-media
Is a new version of code for my [Social media app](https://github.com/kareemAboelatta/social-media-app) with Clean Architecture. 
I used most of Clean code tips with android, SOLID principles and design-patterns..

## Clean Architecture 
I have written about how to architect android application using the Uncle Bob's clean architecture approach. and what's this architecture and why we should use an architecture [here](https://github.com/kareemAboelatta/Clean-architecture).
### And this an old project but i made it again by Uncle Bob's clean architecture approach Let's go and see what's the new here.
